I hope the ensuing Placement Session helps IIIT Guwahati to reach out to their well-wishers successfully. <br>
Though very young, IIIT Guwahati is gradually becoming a contender in research and higher education at the national level. In IIIT Guwahati, the undergraduates receive sound technical grounding with other supporting knowledge, including soft skills. IIIT Guwahati places emphasis on research and is a reflection of the well qualified faculty members that groom the students. This emphasis certainly has a positive impact on the quality of teaching. Here, the students are further exposed to other areas through their courses in basic sciences and humanities. The talent IIIT Guwahati nurtures is unique, and Iâ€™m sure companies that work with cutting edge technologies will seek these well deserving students.<br>
I would like to take this opportunity to invite all corporates, working at the forefront of Information and Communication Technology, to visit IIIT Guwahati for their recruitment drives. <br>

IIIT Guwahati is one of the twenty IIITs set up by the Govt. of India in partnership with State Govt and corporate partners. IIITG has as its partners, the Govts of India and Assam, TCS, Srei Infrastructure Finance, Oil India, and Amtron. In the four years of our existence we have been able to create a teaching and research environment as good as the best in the country. Our Syllabi takes the best from the IIIT and IIT systems and from world-wide trends. We have 35 faculty, 31 of whom have PhDs from IITs, other leading Institutions of the country, and from Universities abroad. <br>
<br>IIIT Guwahati  provides  B.Tech programmes in CSE and ECE disciplines. Admissions are through the JEE Mains All India examination. The second batch is completing its course in May 2018. Most of the students from the first batch are well placed in industries. Some of them also got opportunity to higher education in universities abroad like Carnegie Mellon University, Texas A&M University College Station and Arizona State University.  We started a PhD programme in the second year, showing our commitment to a sound research system. Besides building a world class Institution, our mission is also to give a boost to the development of the ICT industry in Guwahati. The upcoming IT Park next to our campus near the airport will be one of the vehicles for this development.  <br>
<br>I am confident that our students will live up to your expectations and they will become assets in your organization in the years to come. I once again invite you to join our on-campus placement programme.<br>
